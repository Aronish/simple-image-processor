# vtt-image-processor
Interview project related to mixed reality.

Required: C++20, Python 3.12, CMake 3.20 (minimum can probably be lowered a lot if needed). Pybind11 is a submodule, please use ```git clone``` with ```--recurse-submodules```.

```image_processor.py``` should work out of the box, as the module is pre-built in the repo.
